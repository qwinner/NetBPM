renamings in jbpm3
--------- 
* ActivityState --> State 
* Attribute --> Variable (because I always started the explanation with : "attributes are process variables...") 
* ProcessDefinition --> Definition (because it is shorter) 
* DefinitionObject --> Element  
* Flow --> Token (as named in petri nets) 
* performActivity --> endOfState 
* Relations --> Assembler (as named by Fowler in Patterns of enterprise application architecture) 
* decoupled definition event types (for specifying when actions must be triggered) from  
  log event types (when an event occurred) 
  Log events correspond now with service method invocations. 
  Log events and authorization mgr reuse the ServiceMethod persistable enum.

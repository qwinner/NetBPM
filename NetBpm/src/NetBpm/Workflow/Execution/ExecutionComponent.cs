	/// <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
	/// <p>Authentication is letting the ExecutionSession-bean know which user is calling a method.
	/// There are 2 ways of authenticating the User that executes a method upon an ExecutionSession-bean.
	/// <ol>
	/// <li>using J2EE-security and the stateless session bean. See {@link ExecutionSecuredSessionLocalHome}</li>
	/// <li>using the statefull non-secure session bean. See {@link ExecutionSessionLocalHome}.  In this
	/// case, the client can freely specify the user-name.</li>
	/// </ol>
	/// </p>
	/// 
	/// <h3>Component interface</h3>
	/// <p>The two most important interactions with the ExecutionSession-bean are
	/// <ol>
	/// <li><b>Start a process instance</b> : first you need to know the id of the process definition
	/// you want to start.  This can be done by e.g. {@link #getProcessDefinitions()}.  Then start a process 
	/// instance with {@link #startProcessInstance(Long processDefinitionId)}.
	/// </li>
	/// <li><b>Perform an activity for a flow</b> : first a user can get the list of
	/// flows for which he/she is supposed to act through {@link #getTaskList()}.
	/// Then the user can perform the activity with {@link #performActivity(Long,Map)}
	/// </li>
